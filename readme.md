# Ethical Supply Chain Mapper (ESC-M)

**AI-Powered Supply Chain Risk Intelligence Platform**
*Monitor. Predict. Comply.*

---

## 🌍 Executive Summary

Global supply chains face increasing scrutiny over ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) risks — particularly those hidden in deep-tier suppliers (Tier 2 and beyond). **ESC-M** leverages AI, real-time analytics, and dynamic mapping to expose these risks and enable proactive mitigation.

> ⚠️ 90% of supply chain ESG violations occur in Tier-2+ suppliers — *McKinsey, 2023*

ESC-M enables companies to:

* ✅ Proactively mitigate ESG violations
* ✅ Ensure ethical sourcing
* ✅ Protect brand reputation
* ✅ Achieve regulatory compliance

---

## 🚨 Problem

Modern supply chains are complex, opaque, and deeply layered:

* Most companies don’t know their suppliers’ suppliers (*World Economic Forum, 2023*)
* Regulations like the **EU Supply Chain Act** and **US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act** demand full transparency
* Manual ESG audits only cover Tier-1 suppliers

**Key Challenges:**

* ❌ Lack of deep-tier visibility
* ❌ Manual and outdated audit practices
* ❌ Escalating reputational and compliance risks
